    <div class="contentplanet"><p>Venus is considered a terrestrial or telluric-type planet, often called Earth's sister planet, as both are similar in size, mass, and composition. Venus is covered in an opaque layer of highly reflective sulfuric acid clouds, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It has the densest atmosphere among all terrestrial planets in the Solar System, consisting mainly of carbon dioxide.</p></div>
