    <div class="contentplanet"><p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, the second smallest in the Solar System. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often described as the "Red Planet" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of impact craters on the Moon as well as volcanoes, valleys, deserts and Earth's polar caps.</p></div>
